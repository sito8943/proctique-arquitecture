# Proctique Arquitecture
Proctique is a Project Discovery Platform where authors can showcase their work, and users can explore, evaluate, and leave meaningful reviews on published projects. The platform also includes an administrative layer that moderates the community and manages authors, projects, categories, and reviews to ensure a healthy and organized ecosystem.
